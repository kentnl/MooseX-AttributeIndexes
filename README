NAME
    MooseX::AttributeIndexes - Advertise metadata about your
    Model-Representing Classes to Any Database tool.

VERSION
    version 1.0.1

SYNOPSIS
  Implementing Indexes
      package My::Package;
      use Moose;
      use MooseX::AttributeIndexes;
      use MooseX::Types::Moose qw( :all );

      has 'id' => (
        isa => Str,
        is  => 'rw',
        primary_index => 1,
      );

      has 'name' => (
        isa => Str,
        is  => 'rw',
        indexed => 1,
      );

      has 'foo' => (
        isa => Str,
        is  => 'rw',
      );

  Accessing Indexed Data
      package TestScript;

      use My::Package;

      my $foo = My::Package->new(
        id => "Bob",
        name => "Smith",
        foo  => "Bar",
      );

      $foo->attribute_indexes
      # { id => 'Bob', name => 'Smith' }

  Using With Search::GIN::Extract::Callback
      Search::GIN::Extract::Callback(
        extract => sub {
          my ( $obj, $callback, $args ) = @_;
          if( $obj->does( 'MooseX::AttributeIndexes::Provider') ){
            return $obj->attribute_indexes;
          }
        }
      );

  CODERef
    Since 0.01001007, the following notation is also supported:

      has 'name' => (
        ...
        indexed => sub {
          my ( $attribute_meta, $object, $value ) = @_;
          return "$_" ; # $_ == $value
        }
      );

    Noting of course, $value is populated by the meta-accessor.

    This is a simple way to add exceptions for weird cases for things you
    want to index that don't behave like they should.
